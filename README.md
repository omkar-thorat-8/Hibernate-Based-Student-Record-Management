# 🎓 Hibernate-Based Student Record Management System

This repository contains a **Student Record Management System** built using **Java** and **Hibernate ORM**. It demonstrates how to manage student data efficiently by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database using Hibernate.

## 💡 Project Overview
This application provides a simple and effective way to manage student records like student ID, name, course, and marks.<br>
It uses Hibernate for object-relational mapping, making database interactions seamless and clean. 

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java (Core)<br>
- Hibernate ORM<br>
- MySQL (or any RDBMS)<br>
- Maven (for dependency management)<br>
- JDBC<br>
- IDE: Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA <br>

## 🔍 Features
- Add new student records<br>
- View all student records<br>
- Update student details<br>
- Delete student from the database<br>
- Data persistence using Hibernate<br>
- Console-based user interaction (can be extended to GUI or web app)<br>
